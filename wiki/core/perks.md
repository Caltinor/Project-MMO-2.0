Perks are a highly configurable system that allows users to trigger certain abilities when events happen in PMMO.  While PMMO ships with a number of built in perks, the API allows other mods to add their own, which you can then configure to your liking.

*For Developers go [HERE](../api/perks.md)*

## How do perks work
When a perk is configured, it will trigger during the specified event after the custom event trigger but before XP is awarded.  This means that perks do not fire if the requirements for an event are not met, and addons can intercept and even change information relevant to perks before they fire.  Lastly perks can also add XP awards before they are given and change values of events that pmmo has permitted.

In summary, perks allow any addon maker to add custom behavior to a pmmo event that the player can configure to their liking.

## Configuring Perks
all perk settings are in a server config located in your minecraft folder under `/saves/<save name>/serverconfig/pmmo-Perks.toml`.

the basic structure of the config looks like
```toml
[Perks]
    [Perks.For_Event]
        [[Perks.For_Event.EVENT_NAME]]
            perk = "modid:perkid"
        [[Perks.For_Event.EVENT_NAME]]
            perk = "modid:otherperkid"
        [[Perks.For_Event.OTHER_EVENT_NAME]]
            perk = "modid:perkid"
```
*Note that an event can have multiple of the same perk with different configuration, such as to apply to different skills.*

### Individual Perk Configurations
Perks are very dynamic and each perk can have any number of settings.  Because of this, you should consult with the perk author about what settings their perks have.  the PMMO default perk settings are shown at the bottom of this page.  Once you know what settings exist, you can define them in the config file.  for example let's use the perk `pmmo:health` which gives extra hearts to the player based on their skill level
```toml
[[Perks.For_Event.EVENT_NAME]]
    perk = "pmmo:attribute"
    skill = "endurance"
    attribute = "minecraft:generic.max_health"
    per_level = 1
    max_boost = 10
```
This perk has 4 settings `skill`, `attribute`, `per_level` and `max_boost`.  When the `EVENT_NAME` event is triggered, this perk will use the player's endurance level.  This particular perk is then going to give the player extra hearts according to the settings.  In this case it's one half-heart per 1 level of the skill.  So at 9 endurance, the player gets 4.5 hearts.  The max boost sets a cap on how much extra health the player can get from skills.  In this case it is set at 10, or 5 hearts.

Suppose this was my configuration though
```toml
[[Perks.For_Event.EVENT_NAME]]
    perk = "pmmo:attribute"
    skill = "endurance"
    attribute = "minecraft:generic.max_health"
    per_level = 1
    max_boost = 10
[[Perks.For_Event.EVENT_NAME]]
    perk = "pmmo:attribute"
    skill = "combat"
    attribute = "minecraft:generic.max_health"
    per_level = 1
    max_boost = 20
```
in this case the perk is calculated based on my endurance level AND my combat level.  And combat has a higher cap.  You can start to see how perks are dynamic.

As noted above, if you want two perks for the same event and skill, you need to define them separately.  example:
```toml
[[Perks.For_Event.SKILL_UP]]
    perk = "pmmo:attribute"
    skill = "agility"
    attribute = "minecraft:generic.movement_speed"
[[Perks.For_Event.SKILL_UP]]
    skill = "agility"
    perk = "pmmo:fireworks"
```

### Event Configuration
In the above section, we used a generic "EVENT_NAME", but you should be using actual event names.  The full list of event names can be found [HERE](events.md).

It is important to know what your perks do, so that you know what events to put them under.  For example, it may not make sense to use "pmmo:jump_boost" under "BLOCK_BREAK" and have the player hop every time they break a block (as funny as that looks).

### Default Properties
All perks are affected by the following properties.  The below table lists them and the effect it will have on your perk.

| property      | effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|:--------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `cooldown`    | prevents this perk from activating until the duration has elapsed.  Note: this applies to all versions of this perk, not just the perk for that configuration.  For example a firework on level-up would not fire for the second skill if the cooldown had not elapsed |
| `chance`      | a value between 0.0 and 1.0 for the likelihood this perk will execute.  0.1 = 10%                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `skill`       | specifies a skill to supply to this perk. When this is used, the player's level in the skill will be passed to the perk when executed.                                                                                                                                 |
| `min_level`   | the minimum level in the specified skill the player must have for this perk to execute.  omitting the skill will negate this property                                                                                                                                  |
| `max_level`   | the maximum level in the specified skill the player must have for this perk to execute.  omitting the skill will negate thsi property                                                                                                                                  |
| `per_x_level` | Executes the perk only if the player's level is divisible by this value.  omitting the skill will negate this property                                                                                                                                                 |
| `milestones`  | A list of levels that this perk executes for.  omitting the skill will negate this property                                                                                                                                                                            |

| `per_level`      |      0.05       | How much per, level in the skill will the damage be boosted by.  Omitting the skill in this perk will result in no damage boosted                                                                                                                          |

| `multiplicative` |      true       | Makes damage a multiplier.  If false, adds to the damage by a flat amount                                                                                                                                                                                  |
