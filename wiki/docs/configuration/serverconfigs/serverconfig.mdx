    As outlined below, mob scaling values have a bug where Forge's TOML parser will change `"minecraft:generic.attribute"` into `"minecraft:generic".attribute`.  If you don't want the defaults for mob scaling, make sure this format change is manually set back to the first example.  The example below shows what the config should look like if you need a reference.
