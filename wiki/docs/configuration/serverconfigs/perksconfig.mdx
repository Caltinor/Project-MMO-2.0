# Perks Config Syntax and Examples
Perks can be configured via pmmo-Perks.toml.  You will need to know what the properties are for the perk you are configuring.  This will inform you on what to include below the perk `[[]]` header.

For perks from addons, you will need to refer to their documentation, but you can check [here for the Built-in Perk Properties](../../core/perks)

```toml
[Perks]
    [Perks.For_Event]
        #Each perk consists of the "Perks.For_Event." followed by the event that triggers them.
        #As seen below, you can have multiple of these headers with different perks configured
        #beneath them.  Each section/block will be its own perk.
        [[Perks.For_Event.SKILL_UP]]
            perk = "pmmo:fireworks"
            skill = "agility"
        [[Perks.For_Event.SKILL_UP]]
            perk = "pmmo:attribute"
            attribute = "minecraft:generic.max_health"
            skill = "endurance"
            per_level = 0.05
            max_boost = 10.0

        #example perk with a different event
        [[Perks.For_Event.JUMP]]
            perk = "pmmo:jump_boost"
            skill = "agility"
            per_level = 0.0005

        [[Perks.For_Event.RECEIVE_DAMAGE]]
            perk = "pmmo:damage_reduce"
            for_damage = "minecraft:fall"
            skill = "agility"
            per_level = 0.025
