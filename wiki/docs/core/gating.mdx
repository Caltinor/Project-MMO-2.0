# Requirements
Project MMO lets you restrict content based on player skill levels.  These are referred to as "requirements" (or "reqs" for short).  If a requirement is not met for a certain event, the event does not occur.  A simple example of this is having a requirement in "Mining" to be able to use a stone pickaxe.  If you craft/obtain a stone pickaxe before you have the required level, you won't be able to use the tool to mine.  The following sections will go into detail about requirements


## Requirement Configuration
The below table contains every requirement type in the mod as well as what it does.

<Callout variant="info">
    There is no way to fully restrict player crafting, therefore gating crafting events is currently not supported.  The primary reason for this is that most modded crafting tables do not properly use the client's recipebook when coding their crafting menus.  Because the server does not have player-specific recipe lists and Minecraft itself doesn't track the player crafting when a recipe is used, there is nothing to prevent players from using modded crafting benches to bypass crafting requirements.  Furthermore, items like the auto-crafter and other modded auto-crafters pose deeper problems.

## Requirement Negative Effects
There are two requirements that can trigger negative effects: `WEAR` and `BIOME`.  These are effects that are given to players who try to hold/wear an item they can't use or enter biome they aren't skilled enough for.
