# Getting Started (basic PMMO without custom configuration)
Project MMO is all about doing things in game to earn experience and increase your skill level to unlock/improve features.

## A Fresh World
When you first start out, you will craft wooden tools like a regular playthrough.  You won't be able to use stone tools until you reach level 10 in that tool's respective skill.  So you will want to either craft more wooden tools, or prioritize xp sources that give a lot of xp in that skill.  The glossary is invaluable in helping you see what sources give xp for what you need.MMO

## Earning the right XP
Once you are familiar with what XP you need for things from the glossary, it's time to start earning experience.  Some experience will come easier than others.  For example, Excavation has really high xp values and can be earned very quickly.  Mining is given from a lot of sources and can be hastened by prioritizing ores.

Skills like Endurance and Combat are harder to get because they require you to take and deal damage respectively.  Since most players are not taking and dealing damage as often as they are mining or building, it helps to wear items that give you a bonus.  The glossary can show you which special items give bonuses while held or worn, but a really early game solution is leather armor.  If you dye leather armor, each piece gives you a 25% bonus in that skill.  You can hover over the item before crafting to ensure you are dying the correct color.  Black and Red help with combat and endurance respectively.level

## Setting Goals
Depending on the datapack you selected when you started your world, Project MMO's experience scaling will be exponential (default pack) or linear (easy pack). That will tell you how much work it will take to unlock your favorite items.  As you play make sure to do different things to diversify your skills and experience so you can gain more and more access to all of minecraft's content.
