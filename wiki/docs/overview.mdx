# Day 1
When you first start out, you will craft wooden tools like a regular playthrough.  You won't be able to use stone tools until you reach level 10 in that tools respective skill.  So you will want to either craft more wooden tools, or prioritize xp sources that give a lot of xp in that skill.  The glossary is invaluable in helping you see what sources give xp for what you need.MMO
