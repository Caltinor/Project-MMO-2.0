# Project MMO API and Extensions
Project MMO offers multiple ways to extend its features through addon mods or KubeJS.  Most features are contained within the [APIUtils class](https://github.com/Caltinor/Project-MMO-2.0/blob/main/src/main/java/harmonised/pmmo/api/APIUtils.java).

## Summary of API Features
### [Event Triggers](events)
These are Forge event listeners nested within pmmo's own event listeners.  These allow you to apply your own behavior at a specific point in the pmmo event cycle instead of generically during regular event postings.MMO

### [Perks](perks)
Perks are Project MMO's "Abilities".  You can create custom abilities for players, which they can then configure to their liking.

### Custom Configurations Logic
An addon can force the configuration settings for users.  It can also provide its own logic for defining requirments, xp values, and bonuses.  the `APIUtils` class contains these hooks and the documentation to explain them.

### Custom Forge Events
Project MMO provides 4 custom events that it listens to by default.  These can be used to provide compatibility with pmmo.
