# Changelog

## [1.21.1-2.8.39] - 2026-02-13
### Bugfixes/Tweaks-
- Added default texture to biomes and dimensions in glossary to reduce log spam
- Massively increased loading times of the glossary with large packs
- Improved caching of glossary contents to improve subsequent loads

*Developer Note: The Glossary will still lag when attempting to display unfiltered results.  I am planning a next round of optimizations around this specific aspect.  in the meantime, you should see much better performance by selecting at least one filter option to reduce the items the glossary is trying to render*
